about:
  summary: |
    I'm Suyuchen Wang, a Ph.D. candidate at Mila and Université de Montréal. My research lies at the intersection of AI, NLP, efficient long-context processing and multimodal large models. I'm passionate about advancing the state-of-the-art in language modeling, and I love collaborating on projects that have both theoretical depth and practical impact.

    I have worked extensively with large language models, tackling challenges in sequence modeling and instruction tuning. I have a lot of experience in tutoring and making assignments / exams about machine learning and state-of-the-art natural language processing through my TAships. In my spare time, I enjoy road cycling, contributing to open-source projects and taking photos.
